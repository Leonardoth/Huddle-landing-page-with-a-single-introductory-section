This challenge will build on the other two and take it up a notch. You'll need to think about how best to position and space the elements out on the page.

### Brief
Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
See hover states on desktop for all interactive elements
### Learning Outcomes
Think about positioning images and content next to one another. Scaling the content down to mobile without it looking too squashed will be a challenge as well.
